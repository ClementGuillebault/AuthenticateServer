# AuthenticateServer
JWT token authentication server without owin and entity. web api


Basic authentication JWT server.
I have not covered the database part as it is not part of the project. I have not added the repository either.
It is up to you to set up the means of control in database or other.
Does not contain any dependency to Entity Framework or OWIN (easy to set up in the project)
